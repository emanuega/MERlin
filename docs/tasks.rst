Parameters:

* iteration\_count -- The number of iterations to perform for the optimization.

* estimate\_initial\_scale\_factors\_from\_cdf -- Flag indicating if the initial scale factors should be estimated from the pixel intensity cdf. If false, the initial scale factors are all set to 1. If true, the initial scale factors are based on the 90th percentile of the pixe intensity cdf.
* area\_threshold -- The minimum barcode area for barcodes to be used in the calculation of the scale factors.

decode.Decode
---------------

Description: Extract barcodes from all field of views using a pixel-based decoding algorithm. This decoding strategy was originally presented in Moffitt*, Hao*, Wang*, et al, PNAS, 2016.

Parameters:

* crop\_width -- The number of pixels from each edge of the image to exclude from decoding. 
* write_decoded\_images -- Flag indicating if the decoded and intensity images should be written.
* minimum\_area -- The area threshold, below which decoded barcodes are ignored.
* lowpass\_sigma -- The standard deviation for the low pass filter prior to decoding.
* remove\_z\_duplicated\_barcodes -- Remove putative duplicate barcode counts from adjacent z planes.
* z\_duplicate\_zPlane\_threshold -- If removing putative duplicate barcodes, number of adjacent z planes to consider, generally anything within 2 Âµm would be worth considering.
* z\_duplicate\_xy\_pixel\_threshold -- If removing putative duplicate barcodes, maximum euclidean distance in xy pixels that can separate the centroids of putative duplicates.

filterbarcodes.FilterBarcodes
------------------------------

Description: Filters the decoded barcodes based on area and intensity. This filtering strategy was originally presented in Moffitt*, Hao*, Wang*, et al, PNAS, 2016.

Parameters:

* area\_threshold -- Barcodes with areas below the specified area\_threshold are removed.
* intensity\_threshold -- Barcodes with intensities below this threshold are removed.

filterbarcodes.GenerateAdaptiveThreshold
-------------------------------------------

Description: Generate the barcode parameter histograms for the mean intensity, minimimum distance, and area for filtering barcodes with an adaptive threshold. This is run concurrently with decoding in order to minimize the required time.

Parameters:

* run\_after\_task -- The task to start generating the adaptive threshold after. To run concurrently with decode, this can be specified as the preprocess task, otherwise it can be specified as the decode task.
* tolerance -- Tolerance from zero in the optimization routine, if left unset defaults to 0.001. It is useful to adjust this to be more tolerant if an experiment has few blanks or few barcodes overall, as it can be impossible to hit within 0.1% of the requested misidentification rate.

filterbarcodes.AdaptiveFilterBarcodes
----------------------------------------

Description: Use an adaptive barcode to enrich the decode barcodes for the correct barcodes. The adaptive filter selects bins from the three dimension mean intensity, minimum distance, area histogram based on the fraction of blanks within each bin in order to achieve a specified misidentification rate. This filtering strategy was originally presented in Xia*, Fan*, Emanuel*, et al, PNAS, 2019.

Parameters:

* misidentification_rate -- The target misidentification rate, calculated as the number of blank barcodes per blank barcode divided by the number of coding barcodes per coding barcode.

segment.SegmentCells

Description: Determines cell boundaries using a watershed algorithm with the seeds determined from a nuclear stain and the watershed performed on a cell stain.

Parameters:

* seed\_channel\_name -- The name of the data channel to use to find seeds
* watershed\_channel\_name -- The name of the data channel to use as the watershed image.W

segment.CleanCellBoundaries

Description: For a FOV of interest, this task identifies all other FOVs with any overlapping regions, and constructs a graph containing cells from the FOV of interest and all cells from either that FOV or the overlapping FOVs that overlap a cell, with edges connecting overlapping cells

segment.CombineCleanedBoundaries

Description: Combines the cleaned cell boundaries generated for each fov, and eliminates overlapping cells, preferentially removing cells that overlap with the largest number of other cells until there is no more overlap in a given group of cells.

Description: Assembles the images from each field of view into a low resolution mosaic.

sequential.SumSignal

partition.ExportPartitionedBarcodes
----------------------------------

Description: Combines the counts per cell csv files from each fov into a single output file.

slurmreport.SlurmReport
-------------------------------

Description: An analysis task that generates reports on previously completed analysis tasks using Slurm. This analysis task only works when Merlin is run through Slurm with every analysis task fragment run as a separate job. This task uploads the Slurm report to a central repository to track Merlin's performance.

Parameters:

paralleltaskcomplete.ParallelTaskComplete
_________________________________________

Description: Check whether a parallel analysis task has completed all jobs and create a done fine for that task if so. This task does not need to be invoked by the user, it is used by the snakewriter.
